            <p class="other-page-p">Early 2023 after starting my first business, I came up with the idea of 
                a woven watch band to improve comfort. I created schematics for it but never prototyped due to a lack 
                of money. The logo was designed and made by me and there were many rough sketches that led to the final logo. 
                I hope that I can take this idea somewhere and start selling them once I finalize the design.
