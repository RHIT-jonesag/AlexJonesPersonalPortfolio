            <p class="other-page-p">In 2022 after learning how to code with python, I decided to hone my skills 
                by creating my own game completely in python. This game is based on the movie Tron and the lightbikes they use in the 
                movie. In a game sense, it is basically competitive snake, but it has 8 different modes that alter how the game is 
                played. It has a 2 player mode and a CPU mode is planned but not yet finished. Overall, this experience has given me 
                skills in python which I'm sure I'll use in my future.
